# my-pwa

This is my first application to understand how a PWA is configured and how it works. I am using a React application (created with `create-react-app`) as foundation to the PWA.

The page [Making a Progressive Web App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/) has some important 'Offline-First Considerations'

This app is also available on Heroku:

https://blooming-island-50658.herokuapp.com/


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

_This is what you must do if you want to test the application locally. This is a PWA so it will only work in production mode._
